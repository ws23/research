2nd Release

Oct 23 2006
kenlars99 CIVIL capture now is a PushDataSource instead of a customized data source requiring a special handler.  
          It can now be processed by the "Unknown" handler.  This paves the way for using it in processing instead
          of just playback.
kenlars99 PlayerPanel now accepts a URL as a command-line argument.
kenlars99 corrected wrong rgb values for civil video input.
kenlars99 javasound:/ url can be used to get audio from the audio system.  TODO: format selection.  Also, can only be played back 
          through the javasound renderer, so it is not super-useful right now.
          
Oct 30 2006
kenlars99 support ordinal locators for video capture, for example civil:0 will be the first capture source.

Dec 4 2006
